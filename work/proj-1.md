Weightlifting - this sport has taught me so much. Confidence. Strength. Trust. Determination. Community. Love. Balance. Nutrition. Rest. Explosiveness. Drive. It is not too late to find something you are passionate on and to chase it.

Journal topic this week: Tapas. The third of Patanjali's Niyamas. My yoga teacher shared an amazing story of her and I want to share mine to you guys!

I did not have an athlete background. Starting weightlifting and strength training for a couple years at mid 20s were extremely intimidating. 
I didn’t understand how to engage my core. I didn’t understand how to control bar movements. I didn’t breathe right. I was malnutrition to balance with heavy volume training. I was pretty weak. I had many bad days at work and at training. I had very poor cardio. I was lack of self confidence. I can go on and on. These are the actual experience I have had and still struggle some of it. 
It is important for me to understand where I need to work on. For me, I was malnutrition. I had a pretty good coach to actually tell me that. I didn’t know the importance until it is important. 
I started to check in with myself. I learn how to eat strategically to balance with my training. I make sure I get enough rest. I read nutritional books. (Did you know you have to eat 6 cups of broccoli to get the same amount of protein in 1 chicken breast?) I reconfigured my pantry, freezer, and refrigerator with nutrient dense ingredients. I ask why.

I noticed a big difference in my performance when I change my nutrition and be consistent with it. 
Nothing is magic. Things do not magically happen without the correct effort. Understand the WHY, the reasons behind the things that didn’t work and make changes. It is pure self discipline, determine effort, and willingness to grow or die. This is tapas.
